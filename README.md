## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1's turn.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The number rolled will be added to your current score.
3. You can continue rolling the dice and accumulating points until one of the following conditions is met:
   - You roll a 1: If you roll a 1, your current turn ends, and you lose all the points accumulated during that turn. The turn then passes to the other player.
   - You decide to "Hold": If you choose to "Hold," your current turn ends, and your current score is added to your total score. The turn then passes to the other player.

4. The game continues in this manner, with each player taking turns and trying to accumulate points. The player who reaches a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
